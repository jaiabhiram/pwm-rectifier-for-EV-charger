# Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Based Rectifier

This repository contains the files for a Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Based Rectifier system designed to maintain the output voltage at a specified level while achieving a unity input power factor. 

## Introduction

In the realm of power electronics, maintaining a specified output voltage while achieving a unity input power factor is a critical objective. This project is an exploration of a PWM-based rectifier system designed to achieve just that. This repository contains the model files related to the project.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed a Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Based Rectifier system capable of maintaining the output voltage at a specified level while achieving a unity input power factor. The key components of the project include:

- [Description of the system architecture](BTP_Report.pdf)
- [PLECS model file](PWM_Rectifier_Model.plecs)
- Screenshots of the circuit and system outputs
